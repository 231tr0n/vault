# vault
Vault is a password store which stores your passwords in a secure way using aes encryption with gcm. It also makes things easy to backup. All you have to do is to copy the `$HOME/.vault/.passwdstore` file to the same location in another system and everything works as expected.

## Installation
You need to have go toolchain to install this module. With proper go tool chain installation run the command `go install -v github.com/231tr0n/vault@latest`.
